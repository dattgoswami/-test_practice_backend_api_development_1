# Simple API using Node and Express

The task of this assessment is to build a simple API using Node and Express.

## Getting Started

The src folder has index.ts which creates the server and starts listening on port 3000. The recipe_routes creates all the required routes.

## Instructions

Steps to run the project:
Once you have cloned the project repo, navigate to the project directory.

```
npm install
npm run start
//OR
node dist/index.js

npm run test //to run tests
```

After running the npm run start or node dist/index.js you will be prompted that the server has started on port 3000.
Go to this url in the browser:
GET [http://localhost:3000/recipes] - this would display list of recipes
GET [http://localhost:3000/recipes/details/chai] - this would show you the ingrediests and the number of steps
POST [http://localhost:3000/recipes/] - this will add a new recipe to the dataset if it is not already present
PUT [http://localhost:3000/recipes/] - this will update a recipe if it exists in the dataset
